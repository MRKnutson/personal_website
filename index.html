      Working as a biologist sparked my desire to talk to computers.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've always been intrigued by computer languages but growing up I never dedicated the time to 
      really learn them. After becoming a biologist and working in the fisheries field for several years 
      I was encouraged by a supervisor to pursue my M.S. in Fisheries. Although it was likely not my 
      supervisor's intent, the skill that I found the most passion for while obtaining my M.S. was writing
      data analysis scripts in the open-source program R. This ultimately drove me down the rabbit hole of
      becoming more and more interested in computer languages. While working with the Alaska Dept. of Fish
      Game, I worked alongside another biologist and our resident programmer to develop new applications
      that allowed direct entry of biological measurements into a local database that we deploy on our Fish
      and Game research vessel.

      I became so captivated with program development that I began learning some basic HTML, CSS, and 
      javascript on my own. Ultimately, I decided that my interests are in developing useful tools to help
      companies and organizations gather, store, and analyze data and metrics. Now I am scheduled to attend
      the DevPoint labs web development program beginning November 2021.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to utilize the skills that I gain through DevPoint and my career to help improve the data
      collection and storage methods for the people I work with while creating useful and interesting
      interfaces for the front-end user.
